# Novel Sampling in Uncertain Graph Anlytics

BPGraph is a uncertain graph processing framework based on building novel path sampling models.


# Supporting Applications
BPGraph supports the following applications in the implementation, and other algorithms are on developing.

- Multi Source-Target Reliability-based Traversal
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Any-Pair Shortest Search

# Scheduler

Core: Dataflow for Uncertain Graph Traversaling
```
1) Building Paths: File IO -> Construct Ugraph -> Filtered Graph -> Indexed Paths

2) Applications: Construct Queries -> Construct Tree -> Combine Paths -> Answers
```
